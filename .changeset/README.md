# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/master/docs/common-questions.md)

### Important

> Currently, Changesets tool don't always update dependant packages - if their dependency ranges are satisfied by a new version of _package-a_ then an update is skipped.
> For this reason we recommend to not use ranged versions for internal/monorepo dependencies to avoid this [issue](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/issues/476).
